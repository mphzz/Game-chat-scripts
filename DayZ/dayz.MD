# This contains an AAHKSWT for DayZ
- Currently only in v0.1
- Extremely similar to the OW AAHKSWT only changed words per {enter}
- Future changes include formatting specifically around periods at ends of sentences
### DayZ has a 160 char limit in most server's chat
- This means my approach of currently basing it of word count is not proper, and needs to be changed to be based of char count instead
